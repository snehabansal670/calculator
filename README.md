# Calculator Application

This is a simple calculator application built using only HTML and CSS. The calculator interface is designed to resemble a traditional calculator, but it is purely static and does not perform any actual calculations since JavaScript is not used.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The calculator is designed to be responsive, making it accessible on various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **CSS Styling**: The calculator is styled using CSS to resemble a traditional calculator, with button highlights, shadows, and an overall clean design.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the calculator.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the calculator, including layout, colors, and responsive design.
